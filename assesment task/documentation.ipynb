    "## Identifying and Defining:\n",
    "### The data base:\n",
    "The data I am anylising is population growth rate from 1970 to 2022 by country\n",
    "### The purpouse:\n",
    "I am trying to find out which countries have the best growth rate and what those countries are doing differently to others.\n",
    "#### source and access:\n",
    "My source was kaggle\n",
    "link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset\n",
    "The data is a .CSV file so I will access it through CSV\n",
    "## Functional and Non-Fuctional requirments:\n",
    "**Functional requirments** \n",
    "For any of the following to work the user must first have the dataset downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading: The progrm should be able to load csv files this will be done as soon as the user opens the program\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning: The program should be able to filter components of the data at the users will. It should also be able to display the data without any uncessary components. This will be done in each function as neccaecary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis: It should be able to present the mean median, mode and highest and lowest of any number set of the dataset and should be done via a button and or typing. The program would output a number showing the mean, median or mode in number format of the selected number set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualisation: The information is going to be visualised by matplotlib charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Reporting: The system outputs everything as a csv file or a png(for charts).\n",
    "**Non-Functional requirments**\n",
    "The program should be able to be used by people with limited computer expieriance and should be easy and clear on all instructions. The program should be able to reliably open all programs images and not use up too much recources on he computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software should also be able to skip any missing values making sure that it does not crash and makes the program more reliable.\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",

    "User types a number into console\n",
    "System asks user what x and y axis will be\n",
    "User types in the x and y axis\n",
    "system makes a bar graph per the user's request\n",

    "Main Flow:\\\n",
    "user types q into the terminal\\\n",
    "program asks user if they want to save anything before quiting\\\n",
    "if user accepts than ask weather it is a csv or a graph\\\n",
    "terminal makes and saves a new csv file or graph(png)\\\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am trying to find out how the population of developed countries and developing countries decreases or increases and wether these two have any colloration. This is important as it could show the implementations that are not working in countries.\n",
    "1. Developed countries are countries that have already been industrialzed, have high standards of living and have strong economic growth.\n",
    "2. developing countries are not industrialized have lower standards of living and weak economic growth.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There isnt any way to easly compare the world population of different countrys accuratly and reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders include social workers, people who do Demography and normal people interested in the population and the history of it. I doubt that Demographers need it too much as it is probable they have a tool like this themselfs but my code is still available to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "My data will be used to get knowledge of the efficiancy and quality of living of a country and weather that coralates to the population. This will also help Demographers learn more about the population\n",
